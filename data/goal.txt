===MANDATORY PART===

• Executable :
    ./ircserv <port> <password>
        • port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming
            IRC connections.
        • password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries
            to connect to your server.

• The server must be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously without hanging.
• Forking is prohibited. All I/O operations must be non-blocking.
• Only 1 poll() (or equivalent) can be used for handling all these operations (read, write, but also listen, and so forth).

• Use HexChat
• HexChat must be able to connect to your server without encountering any error.

• Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4 or v6).

• Using HexChat with your server must be similar to using it with any
official IRC server. However, you only have to implement the following features:
    ◦ Authenticate
    ◦ Set a nickname, a username
    ◦ Join a channel
    ◦ Send and receive private messages using HexChat.
    ◦ All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to
    every other client that joined the channel.
    ◦ You must have operators and regular users.
    ◦ Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel
    operators:
        ∗ KICK - Eject a client from the channel
        ∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
        ∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
        ∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:
            · i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
            · t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators
            · k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
            · o: Give/take channel operator privilege
            · l: Set/remove the user limit to channel

• Test example :
    Check Subject
